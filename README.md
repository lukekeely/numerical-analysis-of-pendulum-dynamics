Code from experiment. The primary focus was to numerical simulation techniques for differential equations, specifically the nonlinear pendulum.

In this lab exercise, we look at numerical simulation for pendulum dynamics over various conditions. We compare three numerical methods: Eulerâ€™s method, the Trapezoidal Rule, and the Runge-Kutta method.

The experiment began with a linear approximation of the pendulum and then moved to more complex scenarios, including non-linear dynamics, damping forces, and external driving forces.

The linear model is suitable for small initial energies, but accuracy decreases with increasing energy. The introduction of nonlinear terms allowed for more realistic motion at higher energies. Damping forces provided realistic simulations, acting closer to real-world systems. The phase space analysis transitioned from periodic to chaotic behavior over varying driving force amplitudes.

The comparative analysis of the numerical methods showed that Euler's method was less accurate while computationally simple; the Trapezoidal Rule was a good balance between computational complexity and accuracy; and the Runge-Kutta method was ideal for high energy simulations at a higher computation cost.

This lab improves our understanding of pendulum dynamics and how to apply numerical methods to practical physics and engineering problems.
